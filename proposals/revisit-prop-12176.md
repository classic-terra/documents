## Revisiting Proposal 12176 to Inject Liquidity for Terraport LUNC/USDC

This proposal revisits the original Proposal 12176, using the same parameters. It is not being submitted by Terraport themselves, but by the Liquidity Initiative 12171 (the 10 signers approved by governance). The initiative firmly believes that the previous voting outcome—to inject liquidity into the LUNC/USDC pair on Terraport—was based on a misunderstanding.

Some validators argue that Terraport should not receive liquidity because it did not compensate users affected by the 2023 Terraport exploit. However, the procedures and circumstances surrounding compensation were not part of the eligibility requirements defined in Proposal 12171.

The requirements to be eligible are:

- Team KYC
- Project audit

Terraport fulfills these requirements and is therefore eligible.

Please reconsider your vote.
