## Revisiting Proposal 12176 to Inject Liquidity for Terraport LUNC/USDC

This proposal revisits the original Proposal 12176, using the same parameters. It is not being submitted by Terraport themselves, but by the Liquidity Initiative 12171 (the 10 signers approved by governance). The initiative firmly believes that the previous voting outcome—to inject liquidity into the LUNC/USDC pair on Terraport—was based on a misunderstanding.

Some validators argue that Terraport should not receive liquidity because of the 2023 Terraport exploit [conducted by a third party](https://dprk-reports.org/entities/320da41e2132c400c8b5f5f6327d3adfcc507fc8.a91875779aa994b1192867b6be34805bfb0f15e0), claiming it did not compensate affected users. However, Terraport did in fact initiate and execute a compensation process, based on a Terraport governance vote, and many users received compensation. That said, the procedures or adequacy of compensation were not part of the eligibility requirements defined in Proposal 12171.

The requirements to be eligible are:

- Project Team KYC
- Project Code Audit
- The submitted spplication proposal is a spending prop into the 12171 escrow wallet 

Terraport fulfills these requirements and is therefore eligible.

Please reconsider your vote:

- **YES** - If you agree to inject 25k USDC and $25k LUNC equivalent in liqudity for Terraport as outlined in proposal 12171
- **NO** - If you disagree to inject 25k USDC and $25k LUNC equivalent in liqudity for Terraport as outlined in proposal 12171
- **ABSTAIN** - If you don't want to take decisive action
- **NO WITH VETO** - If you belive this proposal constitutes a governance attack
