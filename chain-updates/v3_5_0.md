# Terra Classic - Update v3.5.0 (v12)

**Release Date**:  </br>
**Chain Update Date**: 

## Key Changes
The PR can be found here: https://github.com/classic-terra/core/releases/tag/v3.5.0-rc.0

**TaxExemption Module Introduced:**
A new on-chain module enables tax-exempt transactions based on address groupings called zones. Tax logic is now handled natively by the chain using zone-based rules set via governance.

## Implications / Required Actions
 The TaxExemption Module is a standalone module, so all existing clients and dApps are expected to function as before without requiring any changes
